Okay, I will restructure the roadmap document according to your instructions:

1.  Remove all `*` symbols.
2.  Remove features listed in "FULLY PROGRAMMED FEATURES" and "PARTIALLY COMPLETED FEATURES" from the main roadmap sections (Tier 1-4, Stages 2-19).
3.  Move the provided "Development Status Summary" sections to the very bottom of the document, after the main roadmap and the original "Completed" section.
4.  Ensure the original `[#NNN]` "Completed" items remain in their section.
5.  Keep the rules and prioritization framework at the top.
6.  The features remaining in the main roadmap sections will be those that were marked with `*` (new suggestions) or were original `[#NNN]` items *not* listed as fully/partially completed in the summary provided. I will retain their last assigned priority and (UG, FG, TD) ratings.

Here is the updated roadmap:

### The Oracle Project: Development & Implementation Rules

#### I. Guiding Principles & Philosophy
1.  Each and every feature or function should be accessible from the GUI. No hidden command-line-only features.
2.  Features should be prioritized based on user feedback and the roadmap below. The development path must be transparent and responsive.
3.  User feedback is crucial for prioritizing features, so always consider user requests and suggestions. Establish clear channels for feedback collection.
4.  Never remove a feature once it has been implemented, even if it is no longer used. Features can be deprecated or hidden, but not removed, to ensure backward compatibility for all user workflows.
5.  Never remove an item from the roadmap once it has been added. All "Completed" items should be moved to the "Completed" section at the bottom to maintain a historical record of development.
6.  The application's core purpose is to augment the user's intelligence and creativity, not replace it. Features should empower, not automate blindly.
7.  Simplicity and power are not mutually exclusive. Strive for a design that is clean and intuitive on the surface but offers deep functionality for power users.
8.  The user is in control. The application should never perform destructive actions or share data without explicit user consent.
9.  Consistency is key. A consistent user experience, API design, and coding style makes the application predictable and easier to use and maintain.
10. Build for the long term. Decisions should favor sustainability, maintainability, and future growth over short-term hacks.

#### II. User Experience & GUI
11. Ensure that the application remains user-friendly and intuitive as new features are added. Complexity should be layered, not dumped on the user.
12. All user-facing text must support internationalization (i18n). Hardcoded strings in the UI are prohibited.
13. The application must be fully navigable using only the keyboard. All interactive elements must be focusable and operable via keys like Tab, Enter, Space, and arrows.
14. The UI must adhere to accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA or higher). This includes color contrast, ARIA labels for non-text elements, and screen reader compatibility.
15. UI elements must provide immediate visual feedback for user actions. This includes hover states, click effects, and loading indicators for long-running processes.
16. Error messages displayed to the user must be clear, constructive, and free of technical jargon. They should explain what went wrong and suggest a solution.
17. The application must respect the user's operating system's dark/light mode preference by default, while still offering an in-app override.
18. The application state, such as window size, position, and panel layouts, should be preserved between sessions.
19. Long-running tasks must never block the UI thread. They should be executed asynchronously and provide progress indication (e.g., a progress bar or spinner).
20. Animations and transitions should be purposeful and subtle, enhancing the user experience without being distracting or causing performance issues.
21. Onboarding for new users should be a primary concern. This can be achieved through interactive tutorials, tooltips, or a "Welcome" guide.
22. Every icon or button with no text label must have a descriptive tooltip on hover.

#### III. Architecture & Design
23. All features should be implemented in a way that they can be easily extended or modified in the future. Use design patterns that promote loose coupling (e.g., signals/slots, dependency injection).
24. All features should be implemented with performance in mind, ensuring fast and responsive interactions.
25. Code should be modular and organized, making it easy to navigate and maintain.
26. Adopt a clear architectural pattern (e.g., MVC, MVVM) and apply it consistently throughout the application.
27. Configuration values must be externalized from the code into settings files or a dedicated configuration management system.
28. Data storage schemas must be versioned and include a clear, automated migration path for users upgrading the application.
29. The principle of least privilege must be applied architecturally. Components should only have access to the resources and information strictly necessary for their function.
30. Avoid creating "god objects" or monolithic classes. Break down complex components into smaller, single-responsibility services or classes.
31. The business logic should be decoupled from the UI framework. This allows for easier testing and the potential to create different front-ends in the future.
32. All major architectural decisions must be documented using a lightweight format like Architectural Decision Records (ADRs).
33. Resource management must be handled diligently. Explicitly manage memory, file handles, and network connections to prevent leaks.
34. The application must be designed to fail gracefully. A failure in one non-critical component should not crash the entire application.
35. Utilize feature flags for rolling out complex or potentially unstable features. This allows for remote toggling and phased rollouts.

#### IV. Code Quality & Best Practices
36. All code should be written in a way that is easy to read and understand, following best practices for code style and organization. A linter and automatic formatter must be part of the development workflow.
37. Never use placeholders like `# ...existing code...` in the codebase. Provide the actual code that is being referenced.
38. Never use `# TODO`, `# FIXME`, `# HACK`, or `# NOTE` comments in the codebase. Instead, add the item to the roadmap or an issue tracker. This enforces that all work is tracked and prioritized.
39. Always use clear and descriptive comments in the codebase to explain *why* something is done, not *what* is being done. The code itself should explain the "what".
40. No "magic strings" or "magic numbers"; use named constants for all such values.
41. Functions and methods should be small and adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle. A good rule of thumb is that a function should not exceed a single screen in length.
42. Avoid deeply nested conditional logic. Refactor using techniques like guard clauses, polymorphism, or strategy patterns.
43. All public functions, methods, and classes must have clear docstrings explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values.
44. Variable and function names must be descriptive and unambiguous. Avoid abbreviations.
45. Adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. Abstract and reuse common logic and components.
46. All dependencies added to the project must be explicitly approved and justified. Minimize the number of third-party dependencies.
47. Unused code, dependencies, or assets should be removed from the repository.
48. All code must be written in English. This includes comments, variable names, and documentation.
49. Cyclomatic complexity of functions should be kept low to ensure testability and readability.

#### V. Development Process & Collaboration
50. All code changes must be submitted through a pull request that is reviewed by at least one other developer. No direct commits to the main branch are allowed.
51. Commit messages must follow a conventional format (e.g., Conventional Commits) to enable automated changelog generation and clear history.
52. The `main` branch must always be in a stable, releasable state. All feature development must happen in separate branches.
53. All pull requests must pass the full suite of automated tests (linting, unit, integration) before they can be merged.
54. Each pull request should represent a single, logical unit of work. Avoid creating massive pull requests that are difficult to review.
55. Code reviews should be constructive, respectful, and focused on improving code quality and adhering to project standards.
56. A comprehensive `CHANGELOG.md` must be maintained, detailing all user-facing changes for each release.
57. The application must follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer 2.0.0).
58. Every new feature or bug fix must be linked to a corresponding roadmap item or issue tracker ticket.

#### VI. Testing & Quality Assurance
59. All features should be implemented in a way that they can be easily tested and debugged.
60. Every new feature must be accompanied by a comprehensive suite of automated tests.
61. Every bug fix must include a regression test that fails before the fix and passes after.
62. Unit tests should be fast and focused, testing a single component in isolation.
63. Integration tests should verify the interactions between different components of the application.
64. A target for code coverage should be established and maintained (e.g., >85%), and pull requests that decrease coverage should be scrutinized.
65. Mocking and stubbing should be used to isolate components during unit testing.
66. End-to-end (E2E) tests should be used to validate critical user workflows from the GUI to the backend.
67. Performance and load testing should be conducted for features that are expected to handle large amounts of data or traffic.
68. The testing framework and environment should be easy for any developer to set up and run locally.

#### VII. Security & Data Privacy
69. All features should be implemented with security in mind, ensuring that user data is protected and secure.
70. Never trust user input; all external data must be validated and sanitized on the client-side and re-validated on the server-side (if applicable).
71. Secrets, such as API keys or passwords, must never be committed to the version control repository. They should be managed through secure storage like a system keychain or environment variables.
72. Dependencies must be regularly scanned for known vulnerabilities using automated tools.
73. All network communication containing sensitive data must be encrypted using current, strong protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2+).
74. User data stored locally should be encrypted where appropriate, especially sensitive information like API keys or personal notes.
75. Implement rate limiting and request throttling for any public-facing or resource-intensive APIs to prevent abuse.
76. Output encoding must be applied to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS)-like vulnerabilities in any web-based UI panels.
77. Security-related decisions should be documented, and the codebase should be periodically audited for potential security flaws.
78. Be explicit about data collection and usage in a clear and accessible privacy policy.

#### VIII. Production & Deployment
79. All files being written should be done as though they will be used in production, with proper error handling, logging, and performance considerations.
80. The application must have a robust logging framework. Logs should be structured, written to a file, and have configurable log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR).
81. The build and release process must be fully automated using a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline.
82. The application must provide a simple mechanism for users to report bugs or export logs to aid in debugging.
83. Backward compatibility for user data files and settings must be maintained across major versions whenever possible. If a breaking change is necessary, a clear migration path must be provided.
84. The application should handle being offline gracefully, either by working with local models or clearly communicating the lack of network connectivity.
85. The application should not require administrator/root privileges to install or run.

#### IX. Documentation
86. Provide clear documentation for each feature, including how to use it and any limitations. This includes both user-facing guides and technical documentation.
87. The project's `README.md` file must be kept up-to-date with instructions on how to build, test, and run the project.
88. All public-facing APIs, whether internal or external, must be documented using a recognized standard (e.g., OpenAPI).
89. User documentation should be updated in the same pull request that introduces the corresponding feature or change.
90. A "Getting Started" guide should be available to help new developers contribute to the project quickly.

#### X. Codebase-Specific Rules
91. Never use `'# ...existing code...'` when writing files. Instead, just display the code itself that is being referenced as the existing code.
92. All files being written should be done as though they will be used in production.
93. Never use placeholders.
94. Code comments must never be used to disable or "comment out" code. Dead code should be removed through version control.
95. Global variables should be avoided. Use dependency injection or explicit parameter passing instead.
96. All file paths should be handled in a platform-agnostic way (e.g., using `pathlib` in Python).

### The Oracle Project: Python & PyQt6 Programming Rules

#### I. Python Language Fundamentals
1.  **Follow PEP 8 Strictly:** Adhere to the official Python style guide for consistent and readable code.
2.  **Use Type Hints:** Annotate function signatures and variable types using the `typing` module to improve code clarity and enable static analysis.
3.  **Prefer f-strings:** Use f-strings for string formatting unless complex formatting or Python 2 compatibility (not required here) is needed.
4.  **Use Context Managers:** Utilize `with` statements for resource management (files, locks, network connections) to ensure proper cleanup.
5.  **Write Idiomatic Python:** Favor Python's built-in features and standard library over overly complex or non-Pythonic constructs.
6.  **Use Virtual Environments:** Always work within a dedicated virtual environment for dependency management.
7.  **Organize with Modules and Packages:** Structure the codebase logically into modules and packages based on functionality.
8.  **Avoid `__del__`:** Do not rely on object finalization (`__del__`) for resource cleanup; prefer explicit methods or context managers.
9.  **Standard Library First:** Before adding a third-party library, check if the required functionality is available in Python's standard library.
10. **Ensure Python 3.8+ Compatibility:** Develop and test against the specified minimum Python version (or latest stable release).
11. **Use Properties:** Define controlled access to class attributes using the `@property` decorator.
12. **Prefer Composition over Inheritance:** Design classes by favoring composition to build complex behavior from simpler objects.
13. **Keep Functions Small:** Aim for functions and methods that are concise and focused on a single task.
14. **Avoid Global State:** Minimize the use of global variables; prefer passing data explicitly or using dependency injection.
15. **Handle Exceptions Explicitly:** Use specific exception types in `except` blocks rather than catching generic `Exception`.

#### II. Qt6 & PyQt6 Core Usage
16. **Inherit from `QObject`:** Any class requiring signals, slots, or the object-tree memory management system must inherit from `QtCore.QObject`.
17. **Define Signals with `pyqtSignal`:** Declare signals using `QtCore.pyqtSignal` or `PyQt6.QtCore.Signal` with appropriate argument types.
18. **Use `@pyqtSlot` Decorator:** While optional, decorate slot methods with `@QtCore.pyqtSlot` specifying argument types for clarity and runtime checking.
19. **Connect Signals and Slots Correctly:** Use the new-style connection syntax (`signal.connect(slot)`) unless connecting signals to methods with overloaded signatures (which may require the old `QtCore.QObject.connect` syntax or specifying the signature).
20. **GUI Operations on Main Thread Only:** All creation, manipulation, and deletion of GUI widgets must occur on the main application thread.
21. **Thread-Safe GUI Updates:** Never directly update GUI elements from a background thread. Use signals/slots or `QtCore.QMetaObject.invokeMethod` queued connections for thread-safe communication back to the main thread.
22. **Understand the Event Loop:** Have a solid grasp of the Qt event loop and how events are processed. Blocking the event loop will freeze the GUI.
23. **Prefer Standard Widgets:** Utilize widgets from `QtWidgets` or other standard Qt modules unless complex or highly customized rendering is required.
24. **Use Layouts:** Employ `QtWidgets.QVBoxLayout`, `QHBoxLayout`, `QGridLayout`, `QFormLayout`, etc., for positioning widgets, avoiding fixed sizes unless absolutely necessary.
25. **Set Object Names:** Assign meaningful and unique names to widgets using `setObjectName()` for easy styling via QSS and debugging.
26. **Utilize `QSettings`:** Manage persistent application settings and user preferences using `QtCore.QSettings`.
27. **Understand Object Tree:** Leverage the parent-child relationship of `QObject` for automatic memory management; a child object is automatically deleted when its parent is deleted.
28. **Disconnect Signals:** Disconnect signals and slots when they are no longer needed, especially before deleting objects, to prevent dangling references and crashes.
29. **Use `QTimer`:** For periodic tasks or delayed function calls that need to run on the main thread, use `QtCore.QTimer`.
30. **Handle Events by Overriding:** Implement custom behavior for specific events by overriding the relevant event methods (e.g., `paintEvent`, `closeEvent`, `mousePressEvent`).
31. **Use `QDialog` for Modality:** Employ `QtWidgets.QDialog` subclasses for creating modal windows that block interaction with the main window.
32. **Adopt Model/View:** Use Qt's Model/View architecture (`QtWidgets.QListView`, `QTableView`, `QTreeView` with `QAbstractItemModel` subclasses) for displaying complex data sets.
33. **Implement Custom Models Correctly:** Ensure custom models inherit from appropriate `QAbstractItemModel` base classes and correctly implement required methods (`data()`, `rowCount()`, `columnCount()`, `headerData()`, `index()`, `parent()`).
34. **Use `QDataStream` for Binary:** For efficient binary serialization and deserialization, use `QtCore.QDataStream`.
35. **Use `QJsonDocument` for JSON:** Handle JSON data parsing and generation using `QtCore.QJsonDocument`.
36. **Use `QPainter` for Custom Drawing:** When standard widgets aren't sufficient, use `QtGui.QPainter` within a widget's `paintEvent` to draw custom graphics.
37. **Avoid Excessive Widget Creation/Deletion:** Reusing widgets and updating their content is generally more performant than constantly creating and destroying them.

#### III. GUI Design & Widgets
38. **Design Responsive Layouts:** Ensure layouts adapt gracefully to window resizing and orientation changes.
39. **Configure `QSizePolicy`:** Correctly set the `sizePolicy` property for widgets to control how they grow and shrink within layouts.
40. **Provide Visual Feedback:** Implement visual cues (e.g., changing button state, showing spinners, progress bars) to indicate that an action is in progress.
41. **Validate User Input:** Provide immediate feedback (e.g., changing border color, showing error icons/text) when user input is invalid.
42. **Implement Keyboard Shortcuts:** Define keyboard shortcuts for frequently used actions, aligning with OS conventions.
43. **Ensure Logical Focus Order:** Configure the tab order (`setTabOrder`) so users can navigate interactive elements logically using the keyboard.
44. **Provide Clear Tooltips:** Write concise and informative tooltips for all interactive UI elements, especially icons.
45. **Use Standard System Dialogs:** Employ `QtWidgets.QFileDialog`, `QMessageBox`, `QFontDialog`, etc., for common tasks like opening/saving files or showing messages.
46. **Support High DPI:** Ensure the application scales correctly on high-resolution displays.
47. **Minimize Interaction Steps:** Streamline user workflows to reduce the number of clicks or steps required to perform common tasks.
48. **Implement Undo/Redo:** Provide an undo/redo mechanism for significant user actions where applicable.
49. **Prefer Composition:** Build complex custom UI elements by composing multiple standard Qt widgets within a custom widget class.
50. **Design for Theming:** Structure the UI and QSS to make it easy to apply different visual themes.

#### IV. Architecture (Python & Qt)
51. **Separate Core Logic from GUI:** Strictly separate the application's business logic, data models, and agent code from the PyQt6 UI code. Business logic classes should not depend on PyQt6.
52. **Use Signals for Communication:** Use signals and slots as the primary mechanism for communication *between* decoupled core logic components and the GUI.
53. **Centralize State:** The application's core state and data models should reside in non-GUI classes, managed independently of the visual representation.
54. **Implement a Presentation Layer:** Introduce a layer (e.g., Presenters, ViewModels) that translates data from core models into a format suitable for the UI and handles UI-initiated actions by interacting with core logic.
55. **Dependency Injection:** Use dependency injection to manage dependencies between components, making them easier to mock and test.
56. **Design for Testability:** Structure components so they can be easily instantiated, configured, and tested programmatically without needing a running GUI.
57. **Logical Project Structure:** Organize the codebase directory structure reflecting the architectural layers (e.g., `core/`, `ui/`, `models/`, `services/`, `agents/`).

#### V. Concurrency & Threading
58. **No Blocking on Main Thread:** Operations that take a significant amount of time (file I/O, network requests, complex calculations, model inference) must be performed in background threads.
59. **Use QThread Correctly:** If using `QtCore.QThread`, use the "worker object" pattern: create a `QObject` subclass for the task and `moveToThread()` it to the `QThread` instance, rather than subclassing `QThread` itself.
60. **Use Python's `threading`:** Python's native `threading` module can also be used for background tasks, but thread-safe communication back to the main thread is still critical (signals/slots are the safest way in Qt).
61. **Signals for Thread Communication:** Always use signals (`QtCore.Signal`) to emit progress updates or results from background threads back to the main thread to be received by slots connected to GUI elements.
62. **Thread-Safe Data Access:** Use appropriate synchronization primitives (e.g., `threading.Lock`, `threading.RLock`, `threading.Semaphore`) when multiple threads need to access or modify shared data structures.
63. **Avoid Thread Pools for GUI Updates:** While thread pools (`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`) are useful for general tasks, direct GUI updates from within pool threads are prohibited. Use signals.
64. **Handle Thread Termination:** Implement mechanisms for safely stopping background threads when the application exits or the task is canceled.
65. **Thread-Safe Qt Modules:** Be aware that only specific Qt modules are thread-safe (e.g., `QtCore.QMutex`, `QtCore.QSemaphore`). Most GUI classes (`QtWidgets`) are not.

#### VI. Resource Management
66. **Set `QObject` Parents:** Ensure that all `QObject` subclasses that are part of an object hierarchy have a parent set, so they are automatically cleaned up when the parent is deleted.
67. **Use `deleteLater()`:** For `QObject` subclasses that do not have a parent or whose lifespan is not tied to a parent widget, use `object.deleteLater()` to schedule deletion in the event loop after pending events are processed. Avoid `del object`.
68. **Explicitly Close Non-Qt Resources:** Always explicitly close files, database connections, network sockets, etc., using `close()` or `with` statements.
69. **Handle `None` Gracefully:** Check for `None` or use techniques like the null object pattern to avoid `AttributeError` when dealing with potentially missing objects.
70. **Manage Database Connections:** Use connection pooling or ensure database connections are opened and closed appropriately, ideally within context managers.

#### VII. Testing
71. **Test Business Logic Separately:** Write comprehensive unit tests for core application logic that does not rely on the PyQt6 GUI.
72. **Use `pytest-qt`:** Utilize the `pytest-qt` plugin for testing PyQt6 specific code, including widgets, signals, and dialogs.
73. **Write Integration Tests:** Implement tests that verify the correct interaction and data flow between different decoupled components (e.g., a Presenter and a core Model).
74. **Implement GUI Tests:** Write tests that simulate user interaction with the GUI (e.g., clicking buttons, typing text) using `pytest-qt`'s tools or external GUI testing frameworks.
75. **Mock External Dependencies:** Use mocking libraries (e.g., `unittest.mock`) to isolate code under test from external services (API calls, database, file system).
76. **Regression Tests:** Create a specific test for every bug fix to ensure it doesn't reappear in the future.
77. **Maintain Code Coverage:** Aim for and monitor a target code coverage percentage for tests.
78. **Easy Test Setup:** Ensure the test environment is simple to set up and run for any developer.

#### VIII. Internationalization (i18n) & Localization (l10n)
79. **Wrap All User Strings:** All user-visible strings within `QObject` subclasses must be wrapped using `self.tr("Your text here")`.
80. **Use Translation Tools:** Use the PyQt6/PySide6 translation tools (`pylupdate6`, `lrelease`) to manage translation files (`.ts`, `.qm`).
81. **Load Translators:** Load the appropriate compiled translation (`.qm`) files using `QtCore.QTranslator` based on the application's configured language.
82. **Support Runtime Language Switching:** While a restart is simplest, design the UI update logic to support changing the language preference at runtime and reloading translations.

#### IX. Styling
83. **Prefer Qt Style Sheets (QSS):** Use QSS as the primary method for customizing the visual appearance of widgets.
84. **Organize QSS:** Store QSS rules in separate files (.qss) rather than embedding them directly in Python code.
85. **Use Object Names and Classes:** Leverage widget `objectName` and dynamic properties to create specific and maintainable QSS rules.
86. **Avoid Hardcoding Style:** Do not hardcode style properties directly in Python code if they can be managed more flexibly via QSS.
87. **Design for Multiple Themes:** Structure QSS files to support easy switching between different visual themes (e.g., dark/light mode).

#### X. Error Handling & Logging
88. **Catch Specific Exceptions:** Avoid overly broad `try...except` blocks. Catch only the specific exceptions you expect and know how to handle.
89. **Log Errors:** Use a robust logging framework (e.g., Python's `logging` module) to record errors, warnings, and important information with configurable levels.
90. **Handle API/Network Errors Gracefully:** Implement clear error handling for external API calls or network requests, providing informative feedback to the user.
91. **Validate Data:** Sanitize and validate all external data (user input, API responses, file content) to prevent unexpected errors or security issues.
92. **Report Critical Errors:** For unrecoverable errors, provide a mechanism for the user to report the issue, ideally including relevant log snippets.
93. **Disconnect on Error:** If a connected signal/slot interaction can fail critically, consider disconnecting temporarily or implementing robust error handling within the slot.

#### XI. Deployment & Packaging
94. **Use Packaging Tools:** Utilize standard tools like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze to create standalone executables.
95. **Include Dependencies:** Ensure the packaging process correctly bundles all necessary Python libraries, PyQt6 dependencies, Qt plugins (image formats, platforms), and resource files (translations, QSS, icons).
96. **Include Translation Files:** Make sure compiled `.qm` translation files are correctly located relative to where the application expects them.
97. **Sign Executables:** For distribution on platforms like macOS and Windows, sign the application bundle or executable for trusted installation.
98. **Provide Clear Instructions:** Include documentation on how to install, uninstall, and potentially update the application.
99. **Manage Qt Plugins:** Be aware of required Qt plugins (e.g., `platforms/`, `imageformats/`) and ensure they are correctly included in the bundled application.
100. **Cross-Platform Testing:** Test the packaged application on all target operating systems to identify platform-specific issues.

### **The Oracle Project: Prioritization Framework (P1-P5)**

This framework is used to assign a clear, actionable priority to every feature on the roadmap. It ensures that development effort is focused on tasks that deliver the most value to users and the product, balancing strategic goals with implementation complexity.

#### **Input Metrics**

Each feature is evaluated against three core factors:

*   **User Gain (UG):** How much direct value, convenience, or problem-solving capability this brings to the end-user. (Scale: 1-5)
*   **Functionality Gain (FG):** How much this expands the core capabilities of the application, unlocking new types of workflows or serving as a prerequisite for future features. (Scale: 1-5)
*   **Technical Difficulty (TD):** The estimated effort, complexity, and risk to implement the feature robustly, including testing and documentation. (Scale: 1-5)

#### **Priority Levels**

| Priority Level        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   | Typical Profile                                                                                                 | Action / Timeline                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[P1] Critical**     | **Absolutely essential features.** These include foundational components, fixes for critical regressions, or features that address severe user pain points. They are often prerequisites for other high-value work. | High UG/FG, Low-to-Medium TD (Quick Wins), or an absolute necessity regardless of TD (e.g., Regressions).        | **Implement Immediately.** This is the current, active development focus.                               |
| **[P2] High**         | **Important features that provide significant value** and align directly with the current stage's objectives. They make the product substantially better for a large portion of the user base.   | High UG/FG, Medium-to-High TD. Represents the core work of a development cycle.                                 | **Implement Next.** These features form the backlog for the upcoming development cycle(s).              |
| **[P3] Medium**       | **Valuable quality-of-life improvements,** features for secondary use cases, or enhancements that build upon existing P1/P2 features. They add polish, depth, and user delight.                  | Medium UG/FG, Low-to-Medium TD. Excellent for filling out sprints or when P1/P2 tasks are blocked.             | **Schedule for Future Sprints.** To be implemented after the current block of high-priority work.    |
| **[P4] Low**          | **Niche features that benefit a smaller subset of users,** complex enhancements with lower immediate gain, or non-critical "nice-to-have" ideas.                                               | Low-to-Medium UG/FG, or High TD for a low return on investment.                                                 | **Place on Backlog.** Re-evaluate periodically.
